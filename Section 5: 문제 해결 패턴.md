# Master common problem solving patterns (Programming mechanism)

### Frequency Counter 빈도 세기

- Using **objects** or sets to collect values/frequencies of values

### Multiple Pointers

- Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position
- moving towards the beginning, or the end or middle based on a certain condition
- Searching for a pair of values or Something that meets a condition

### Sliding Window

- Creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another.
- the window either increases or closes, and a new window is created (depending on a certain condition)
- Useful for keeping track of a **subset** of data that is continuous in some way.

### Divide and Conquer

- Dividing a big data set(array, string, linked list, tree) into **smaller chunks**
- Repeating a process with a subset of data
- Approach on many algorithm (e.g. binary search, merge sort, quicksort)

### Dynamic Programming

### Greedy Algorithms

### Backtracking
